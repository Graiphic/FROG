# 🐸 FROG — Free Open Graphical Language


# DETERMINISTIC DATAFLOW EXECUTION

FROG uses a true dataflow execution model.

Nodes execute when their inputs become available.

This enables:

- parallel execution by default  
- deterministic behavior  
- efficient hardware utilization  
- scalable performance  

Execution is driven by data flow, not by instruction order.

---

# OPEN BY DESIGN

FROG is fully open and openly specified.

This guarantees:

- vendor independence  
- long-term stability  
- transparent execution  
- community-driven evolution  

Anyone can implement the language.

Anyone can build tools, runtimes, or compilers.

Anyone can extend the ecosystem.

# FROG IS A FOUNDATION

FROG is a foundation for graphical programming where:

- the diagram defines execution  
- the front panel defines interaction  
- the program expression is fully open  
- execution is secure and optimized  
- the language remains independent
